        <p>Hi! My name is Jennifer Autrieb and I'm 22 years old.
        I'm from Stockholm originally, but I just recently moved to Kalmar to study.
        I'm a happy, but laid back person, who likes to hang out with friends and
        work out. I've tried out a lot of different</p>
        
        <p>Before I moved here I worked at a coffeshop. I'm a trained barista since 2011,
        but this past year I chose to expand my work experience a little bit.
        Instead of being a barista, I became a cold-buffet manegeress. It suited me
        far better. Maybe because cooking is something i really like doing!</p>
        
        <p>This is a list of the food I like most:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shepherd's pie</li>
            <li>Moussaka</li>
            <li>Fatanyeros</li>
            <li>A really good hamburger</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But enough about that....</p>
        
        <p>Before all this I studied advertising in Stockholm at Berghs School of Communication.
        I felt that it was interesting, and maybe something that I wanted to work
        with in the future. But I didn't have the money at the time, so I started
        working instead. And after a year or two, I didn't really habe the same urge
        to go back. Therefor I chose this program. I believe it suits my personality
        and future better.</p>
        
        <p><h3>My family</h3></p>
        <p>In Stockholm I lived with my father, which I've been doing since I was 16
        years old. The reason for that is beacause my mother decided to move out on the
        countryside. I don't know about you, but when I was 16 years old, I certainly
        did not want to live on the countryside when I was so used to having the city
        around me all the time.
        Anyway, those are my parents. Lars, my father. And Maria, my mother.
        I also have a brother, who is 15 years older than me. His name is Patrik, and
        he has a lovely family. A wife, and two beautiful kids.</p>
        
        <p><h3>My qualities</h3></p>
        <p>I believe that my main good quality is that I'm a fast learner, and that I
        adapt very well to new groups and situations. I may not always like the
        situations I'm in, but I can determine if it's important enough to just do it.
        It is really hard to evaluate yourself, especially what you're bad at.
        I guess I struggle with myself being too, well, not judgemental, but cautious
        around new people. I myself am a very laid back person, and if someone just
        walks in the room all happy and bubbly, I will probably keep an extra eye on
        on that person.</p>
        
        
        <p>Since this is a school-project, I really need to talk about my previous skills.
        I have no previous skills. Well, maybe some in HTML, but that was a long time
        ago, even though I do remember some things. When it comes to programming I
        have zero experience. But I do think it's really fun and rewarding.
        Many people have asked me why I chose this program. And since I don't have
        any experience it has been hard to explain in a good way why. I just had a
        really good feeling about it, and I still do.</p>
        
        <p><h3>My thoughts about the future</h3></p>
        <p>I havent really thought that much about my future. I don't plan to move back
        to Stockholm, even though my family wants that, and can't believe that I
        actually like it here far better than I like it in Stockholm.</p>
        
        <p>I'm hoping to...</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Get a job.</li>
        <li>Permanently move from Stockholm.</li>
        </ol>

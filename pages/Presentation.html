        <h1>My very own blog.</h1>
        <br>Hi! My name is Jennifer Autrieb and I'm 22 years old.
        <br>I'm from Stockholm originally, but I just recently moved to Kalmar to study.
        <br>Before I moved here I worked at a coffeshop. I'm a trained barista since 2011,
        <br>but this past year I chose to expand my work experience a little bit.
        <br>Instead of being a barista, I became a cold-buffet manegeress. It suited me
        <br>far better. Maybe because cooking is something i really like doing!
        <br>But enough about that....
        <br>
        <br>Before all this I studied advertising in Stockholm at Berghs School of Communication.
        <br>I felt that it was interesting, and maybe something that I wanted to work
        <br>with in the future. But I didn't have the money at the time, so I started
        <br>working instead. And after a year or two, I didn't really habe the same urge
        <br>to go back. Therefor I chose this program. I believe it suits my personality
        <br> and future better.
        <br>
        <br><h3>My family</h3>
        <br>In Stockholm I lived with my father, which I've been doing since I was 16
        <br>years old. The reason for that is beacause my mother decided to move out on the
        <br>countryside. I don't know about you, but when I was 16 years old, I certainly
        <br>did not want to live on the countryside when I was so used to having the city
        <br>around me all the time.
        <br>Anyway, those are my parents. Lars, my father. And Maria, my mother.
        <br>I also have a brother, who is 15 years older than me. His name is Patrik, and
        <br>he has a lovely family. A wife, and two beautiful kids.
